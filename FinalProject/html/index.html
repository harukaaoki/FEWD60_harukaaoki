						<h3>Here are a few things to consider <br> before you reach for that GMO-free tomato.</h3>

						<p>GMO (Genetically Modified Organism), also known as a transgenic organism, <br> is any organism whose genetic material has been altered <br>using genetic engineering techniques. - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetically_modified_organism" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a></p>

		<h3>1. It's complicated.</h3>
			<p>GMOs are not evil. A GMO label may not tell you that <br> the apple you're holding was sprayed with dangerous herbicides.<br> At the same time, you can have an organic, genetically <br>engineered apple that's delicious and safe to eat.</p>

		<h3>2. Genetically modified food is nothing new.</h3>
			<p>In fact, we have been selectively breeding species for more than 15,000 years.<br> As astrophysicist and science communicator Neil Degrasse Tyson reminds us, <br>"Practically every food you buy in the store for consumption <br>by humans is genetically modified food." See how it's quite pointless to go anti-GMO?</p>

			<h3>3. There is NO substantial evidence that <br>GMOs are unsafe to consume.</h3>
			<p>The World Health Organization, the American Medical Association, the National <br>Academy of Sciences, and the American Association for the Advancement<br>of Science, among others, have assured the safety of GMOs.</p> 
			<p>Take a look at <a href="http://www.geneticliteracyproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/GLP-Science-and-GMOs.pdf" target="_blank">this graphic</a> that shows which scientific organisations around<br> the world have mentioned the safety of crop biotechnology.</p>

			<h3>4. GMO-free does not mean safe, healthy, and all around #FABULOUS</h3>
				<p><span>"But 'GMO-free' does not mean fair trade, and it does not mean sustainable, <br>and it does not mean monoculture-averting, and it does not mean <br>rainforest-enabling, and it does not mean labor-friendly, and it does not<br> mean healthy, though it puffs its chest and carries itself alongside those claims."

			<h3>5. GMO labels don’t clarify what’s in your food.</h3>
			<p>"They don’t address the underlying ingredients—pesticides, toxins, proteins—that supposedly make GMOs harmful. They stigmatize food that’s perfectly safe, and they deflect scrutiny from non-GMO products that have the same disparaged ingredients." - William Saletan, <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2015/07/are_gmos_safe_yes_the_case_against_them_is_full_of_fraud_lies_and_errors.html">Slate</a></p>

			<h3>6. Don't be intimidated by the science.</h3>
	<!-- 		<img src="something.jpg" alt "Papaya"> -->
			<p>Just because GMOs are now made in the lab, does not mean that all GMOs <br>are inherently unhealthy or dangerous. If you find yourself saying, "The science  <br>behind GMOs are too complicated, and I can't bother to deal with all of this!",<br> embrace the uncertainty and learn more about the issue.</p> 
			
			<p>More knowledge never hurts, especially when it <br>concerns your health and the health of the environment!</p>

			<h3>7. Don't blame the GMO. Blame our egos.</h3>
			<p>Anti-GMO activists often attribute superpests and herbicide-resistant weeds<br> to GMOs, however, the problem actually lies in relying on the same crop and same method of weed control over and over again.</p>
			<p>"The worst you could say, is that having these superstar, genetically modified plants <br>may create a perverse incentive for monoculture because then everybody <br>wants to use the most profitable, best seeds."</p>

			<h3>8. Demand better GMOs.</h3>
			<p>Getting rid of GMOs won't get rid of food covered with dangerous pesticides.<br>Creating better GMOs and letting go of our fear of genetic engineering may lead to healthier foods. <br>Educate yourself on the latest findings, talk to farmers at your local <br> farmers market, communicate to your policymakers that you want better GMOs,<br> and educate the people around you.</p>

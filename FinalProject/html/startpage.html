				<h1>GM Uh Oh! Genetically Modified Organisms in your Grocery Store.</h1>
				<p>Despite the fact that over 90 percent of people want genetically modified organisms (GMOs) labeled, we still don't have that right in the U.S. -- yet. But we are not powerless.Foods that are genetically modified have had their DNA structure changed, with a goal of improving the organism (taste, yield, disease resistance). genetic engineering involves the addition of foreign genes that would not occur in nature. This might make it more resistant to herbicides, so that it can grow while weeds around it are treated. However, several studies have shown a potential connection between genetically modified foods and illnesses such as cancer, infertility, and severe allergies. While European countries are banning GM foods, at the same time their researchers are encouraging the technologies. not everyone agrees that GMOs are safe to eat, especially over the long term. Some scientists fear that GMOs could cause allergies in humans. Others point to the environmental consequences of the farming of GE crops.How do GMOs affect the environment? One word: Pesticides. Hundreds of millions of extra pounds of pesticides. The six biggest producers of GE seeds—Monsanto, Syngenta, Dow Agrosciences, BASF, Bayer, and Pioneer (DuPont)—are also the biggest producers of chemical herbicides and insecticides. </p>
